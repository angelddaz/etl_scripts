# ETL scripts from a single internship
These are PowerShell scripts and C# script I wrote for a single internship, ETL workflow.

These scripts are for file management: changing the file creation date
and deleting files that are older than a certain amount of days before
present day. I wrote them to automate archiving. There were files I didn't
want deleted yet, so I wrote the script which changed the file creation date.

The C sharp script zips up, moves, and deletes original .txt files from one directory to another. It was used at the end of an ETL SSIS package.
