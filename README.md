# powershell_scripts
These are PowerShell scripts I have written for file management and manipulation

These scripts are for file management: changing the file creation date
and deleting files that are older than a certain amount of days before
present day. I wrote them to automate archiving. There were files I didn't
want deleted yet, so I wrote the script which changed the file creation date.
